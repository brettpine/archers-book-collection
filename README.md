# Book Tracker for My Son

This project is a website I created to keep track of the books my son owns, so we don’t accidentally buy duplicates. The website displays the books in a list, which I can easily update through a Contentful API. The main goal of this project was to practice and improve my skills in front-end web development, including my first experience working with an API.

## Features

- View a list of books owned by my son
- Book details are fetched dynamically from the Contentful API
- Ensure no duplicate books are purchased by checking the book list

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages
- **CSS**: For styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For handling interactivity and API calls
- **Contentful API**: Used to manage and retrieve the book data (my first experience working with an API)

## How It Works

1. **Contentful API**: The book collection is managed via Contentful, a headless CMS. I use the Contentful API to store and manage the book data. This allows me to easily add or remove books from the collection without needing to update the code directly.

2. **Frontend**: The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6). JavaScript fetches the list of books from the Contentful API and dynamically displays them on the page. This keeps the website content up to date without requiring manual updates in the code.

3. **Viewing Books**: Users can browse through the list of books my son owns. While the website doesn’t allow adding or removing books directly through the interface, I can easily make those updates in Contentful whenever necessary.

## Why I Built This

This project was an exercise in web development and a way for me to practice my skills. It was one of my first projects that involved using an external API, which was a valuable learning experience. By working with Contentful, I gained a better understanding of how to integrate APIs into front-end projects and manage dynamic content.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhance the UI**: Implement modern design frameworks such as Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is fully responsive across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Book Sorting**: Add sorting functionality to order books alphabetically by title or by the date they were added.

## Acknowledgements
